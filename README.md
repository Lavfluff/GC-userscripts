- [**Discord webhook Smugglers Cove logger**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lavfluff/GC-userscripts/refs/heads/main/gc-discord-webhook-smugglers-cove-logger.js): Share your Smugglers Cove visits with your guild friends! All you need to do is set-up the webhook in your guild's discord server and enter the URL into the pop-up on first visit. You may also add multiple URLs too if you want to share with multiple discord servers.
